### SENG8120 â€“ Modern Automated Testing (Version: Alpaca)

### Purpose

This repository contains **Assignment 3**, where we used **Jest** to create a fully tested set of paint project calculation utilities using **TypeScript**.

Each function has been unit tested with a focus on edge cases, proper error handling, and code quality.
